# covitrace
## Version 1.5
## App for Covid Vaccination Analysis
The covitrace is a tool designed using Python and Streamlit to analyse covid vaccination. Current functionality includes:

* Raw vaccinations data as on date
* Date filter
* Vaccinations progress (global)
* Vaccinations progress (countrywise)
* Vaccinations progress (comparison)

A running version of the app can be accessed at https://tinyurl.com/covitrace. The app may run slowly when accessing it. This is due to the hosting and should not affect functionality.

## Notes on Usage
The app can be cloned and run locally using streamlit: streamlit run covitrace.py. When doing this, ensure you have the required modules listed in the requirements file.
Scales on interactive plots can be changed by double clicking on the lower/upper limit values.
